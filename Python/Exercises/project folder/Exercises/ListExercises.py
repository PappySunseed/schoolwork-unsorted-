#1. Total Sales
#Design a program that asks the user to enter a storeâ€™s sales for each day of the week. The
#amounts should be stored in a list. Use a loop to calculate the total sales for the week and
#display the result.
sales = [0]
sales = [sales[0]] * 7

    days = {
        0: "Monday",

        3: "Thursday",
        4: "Friday",

        6: "Sunday"

#6. Larger Than n
#In a program, write a function that accepts two arguments: a list, and a number n. Assume
#that the list contains numbers. The function should display all of the numbers in the list
#that are greater than the number n.
